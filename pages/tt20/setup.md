# Setup

This part of the wiki will guide you through the simple process of installing TT20 on your server.

## Basics

First, go to the [Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/mod/tt20) and download the version of the mod that suits your
server's version and software. Simply drag the downloaded jar file into your `mods` folder, and you're ready to go. Your
players do not need to install TT20, in fact, they shouldn't. Even a vanilla client can join your server and enjoy the
benefits of the mod.

In singleplayer, TT20 may be a little harder to install. The first step, of course, is to install TT20 by putting it
into your `mods` folder. After you've started your game at least once with the mod enabled, check your config folder for
a separate folder inside named `tt20`. Inside you will likely see multiple files. You want to open the `config.json` and
change the `singleplayer-warning` value to `false`. Don't forget the comma at the end! Now either restart your game or
run the `/tt20 reload` command.
