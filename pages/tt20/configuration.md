All about config is here!

## Config file

**What is it?**

Config file is where mod saves it's settings,\
so you don't need to toggle functions after each restart

**How do I find it?**

1. Navigate to your game folder
2. Go to `config` folder and then to `tt20`
3. Here it is! `config.json` is the main config file

BEGIN NOTE
**Note:** you need to start game with the mod once, so config files can generate
END NOTE

**Config explanation**

All options below require `boolean` (`true`/`false`)\
if you'll put something except `boolean` it will use default value

| config key                  | default value | explanation             |
|-----------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| `enabled`                   | `true`        | Is TT20 enabled         |
| `block-entity-acceleration` | `false`       | Ex. chest opening speed |
|                             |               |                         |

BEGIN NOTE
**Note:** be careful with json structure, don't brake it!
