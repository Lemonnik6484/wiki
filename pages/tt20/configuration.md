## Config file

**What is it?**

Config file is where mod saves it's settings,\
so you don't need to toggle functions after each restart

**How do I find it?**

1. Navigate to your game folder
2. Go to `config` folder and then to `tt20`
3. Here it is! `config.json` is the main config file

BEGIN NOTE
**Note:** you need to start game with the mod once, so config files can generate
END NOTE

---

**Config explanation**

1. `enabled` decides if mod is enabled (`true`/`false`)
2. `block-entity-acceleration` 

BEGIN NOTE
**Note:** be careful with json structure, don't brake it!
END NOTE
